# Meow Haven

## Description

Meow Haven is a cozy, interactive game where players design a catâ€™s room, place furniture, and care for a virtual cat. Players can drag the cat around the room and trigger different animations by interacting with objects like food bowls, toys, and beds. The game features custom pixel art, responsive layout, and playful motion design to create a warm and engaging user experience. 

This game has been optimized for all devices and works seamlessly across various screen sizes. While it is fully responsive and functions well on desktop browsers, mobile phones are highly recommended for the best experience due to the design being tailored for smaller screens and touch interactions.
